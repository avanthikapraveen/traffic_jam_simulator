## Project Description
This project simulates the experience of being stuck in traffic. Users can honk horns, and experience the absurdity of waiting in a traffic jam without leaving their homes!

## The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)
Ever wanted to know how it feels to be in traffic without actually being in traffic? Maybe not, but now you can experience it with just a few clicks!

## The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
We simulate the whole experienceâ€”honking, endless waiting. Now, you too can experience the pointlessness of a traffic jam, anytime, anywhere!
